## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze Airbnb prices in San Diego to identify the best neighborhoods to purchase an Airbnb property. As an aspiring Airbnb host, I wanted to gain a better understanding of the San Diego housing market and identify potential investment opportunities. Additionally, I sought to improve my data manipulation skills by cleaning and filtering the data with Tidyverse, creating visualizations using ggplot2, and developing a Shiny dashboard to showcase my findings. Through this project, I not only gained valuable insights into the San Diego housing market but also enhanced my skills in data analysis and visualization, preparing me for future data-driven projects.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, through this project, I was able to gain valuable insights into the San Diego Airbnb market and identify the best neighborhoods to purchase an Airbnb property. Based on my analysis, I discovered that Mira Mesa and Barrio Logan are ideal for lower-priced Airbnbs due to their lower average price and higher number of listings. On the other hand, La Jolla and Mission Bay are suitable for higher-priced Airbnbs due to their high price and high number of listings. Additionally, I improved my data manipulation skills in cleaning and filtering data using RStudio and Tidyverse, and developed a range of visualizations using ggplot2, including box plots, colored bar charts, histograms, and lolipop plots. This project has not only provided me with valuable insights into the San Diego housing market but also enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills, preparing me for future data-driven projects.
